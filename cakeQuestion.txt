Suppose we are slicing a cake to divide it between 5 people. I cut myself a big slice, consisting of 33.3 percent of the whole cake. Now it is your turn to cut a slice of cake. Will you also cut a 33.3 percent slice? Or will you be fairer and divide the remaining 66.6 percent of the cake into 4 even parts? How big a slice will you cut?
